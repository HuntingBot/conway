- Calculating and ticking to the next generation takes ~15ms right now. This could be optimized by only testing cells that are either alive or neighbors of alive cells.

- Optimize for mobile. The game is playable on iOS, but tapping cells too quickly is interpreted as a zoom in/out double tap. (UPDATE: there isn't an event for the double-tap-zoom, but this might be possible using touchstart/touchend with timestamps)

- Make sure methods are named properly and ordered properly.

- Read every line of code again.
